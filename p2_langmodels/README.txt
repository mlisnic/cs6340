We've provided two sets of sample files.

a) train1.txt and test1.txt are tiny, so you can use these files to get
some intuition about what your system should do. The correct output
file is langmodels-output1.txt .

b) train2.txt and test2.txt are more typical examples of a text
corpus and sample sentences. The correct output file is
langmodels-output2.txt .

We also provided a sample seeds file (seeds.txt) and output file
(langmodels-gen.txt) for the -gen option for the generation task for
cs6340 students. This uses train2.txt for training. Of course, this
component involves random number generation so do not expect your
results to exactly match ours! But you can use this output file to see
the correct formatting and get a general idea of how your system
should behave.

Good luck!
